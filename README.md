# Playing with Orthographic Projections

This is a little game developed in Unity (C#) that I worked on over a weekend for a game design class in college

## Concept

* I was mostly messing around with Orthographic Projections, and seeing what cool effects I could get out of that.
* I was more or less inspired by Monument Valley, but with obviously much less time and resources than what was poured into that game I tried to mess around with some cool little puzzles.

## How to Open / Play
